# Obscura

Obscura was the final project for Advanced Game Development Class in my third year of university. The game is hosted here and can be played on Firefox, Safari or Internet explorer browsers.

# About
Obscura is a 3D adventure platformer. In the game, a meteor has crashed onto the earth breaking the world into two dimensions and separating the world into many pieces. Many meteor shards have been scattered throughout the world and it's the player's job to bring the world back together by collecting them.
